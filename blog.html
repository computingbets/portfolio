      <div class="album">
      <div class="joke_writer"></div>
      </div>
      <p class="casey">When I first saw Mr. Casey Crawford perform stand-up, it was near Fenway Park. Fitting because he belted out hit joke, one after the other.</p>
      <p>So, on Friday, September 20th, Casey continued to hit great jokes for a solid hour. Opener and host, Rob Crean performed tremendously, even a bit more expressive during his set than usual... probably thee excitement of the night 😎</p>
      <p class="casey2">Casey called his album, "Joke Writer" and it's all killer, no filler. One-liners for an hour... a comic said that's 3 jokes a minute... 180 jokes. Bandcamp for 9-10 bucks? 18 jokes from Boston Comedy winner and Jimmey Kimmel guest - @ 18 jokes a dollar. Dang. That's like nickel brews or somethin'. In Davis Sq.... $10 PBRs. Casey should have joked about that by poopin on mgmt's faces. 🏁 Great night of comedy. No, that's all. But I did hear a guy in a Jurassic Park shirt say there was an after-party at a comic's house nearby. Then, I guy who wears a kilt and had a sea-green beard told me he was goin' partyin' while I waited an extra 30min at the bus stop. I didn't even go to her party's when I was her neighbor! I said, I <em>prefer</em> being apart of the scene for over 15yrs and not being invited. 15 y/o Riffraff. Man, Casey's great.</p>


    <h3 class="header_color" class="money_post">Stonk Formula Revised: -ff Forced Fundamentals</h3>
    <img class="stonk" src="img/blog_img/forumala_ad.png" alt="stonk ad for Eq. + Vol., Equity & Volume">
    <ul>
     <li> "Of Pyramids and Ponzis" Bitcoin has value based on scarcity. The less of BTC, the more it's worth, i.e. The Halvening. Well, what makes a stock price go up in value? More demand than supply. So, low supply -> BTC Kenosha kastle. A share is part of a company and a token good for a company's service. Can you give Solana to an UberEats? That's a fast burger! And, no, you cannot. </li> 
     <li> The formula of Volume + Equity + PP (price performance), if you were a computer run-time, the formula akins to tossing in thee flag -f 🤓 loll 💬 -ff "forced fundas"🖖 l33t. Only me? Famed economist John Maynard Keynes reported fundas have nothen to do with it! Like vegetables, fundamental stocks are good for the financial body and, also like your veggies, grow slowly. "Keynesian stocks" means popular, means buzzy, hype, abd means the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutch_tulip_bulb_market_bubble.asp"> Tulip Mania</a> 🌷. A highly equitable stock that's been performing exceedingly well, with high volume... -fizzle out 🥤🐻</li>
     <li> Peter Lynch, of Fidelity Investments, has famous patience. While been less good than Famous Amos, Frere Pete would say to have good TAST. I used the formula above to buy cashtag $TAST. TBH, it slid 85%. 🛝🐩💩 Then, it went up 400% and got bought out. Dr. Stale's formula also led to $YPF, which also slid, then a gain +100%. I did not hold for the slide. So, LESSON LERRNED => possess <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8OnFf1HgBisM"> mathmatical emotions, a calcu-soul. </a></li> 
     <li> My Final Thoughts: (Volume + Equity + PP + P/B or P/S + ROA or ROE) = Energy companies & Banks! Equity & Price Performance don't matter as much... market will eat your prescription lunch (Keynes 🌷) Conviction! Peter Lynch! (Mutally exclusive) Take care of yourself... aaand your stonks.</li>
