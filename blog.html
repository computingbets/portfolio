    <ul>
     <li> "Of Pyramids and Ponzis" -I'm barely blacked out... or are you BEARly blacked out? Yeah, Bitcoin has value based on scarcity. The less of BTC, the more it's worth, i.e. The Halvening. Well, what makes a stock price go up in value? More demand than supply. So, low supply -> BTC Kenosha kastle. A share is part of a company and a token good for a company's service. Can you give Solana to an UberEats? That's a fast burger! And, no, you cannot. </li> 
     <li> The formula of Volume + Equity + PP (price performance), if you were a computer run-time, the formula akins to tossing in thee flag -f 🤓 loll 💬 -ff "forced fundas"🖖 l33t. Only me? Famed economist John Maynard Keynes reported fundas have nothen to do with it! Like vegetables, fundamental stocks are good for the financial body and, also like your veggies, grow slowly. "Keynesian stocks" means popular, means buzzy, hype, abd means the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutch_tulip_bulb_market_bubble.asp"> Tulip Mania</a> 🌷. A highly equitable stock that's been performing exceedingly well, with high volume... -fizzle out 🥤🐻</li>
     <li> Peter Lynch, of Fidelity Investments, has famous patience. While been less good than Famous Amos, Frere Pete would say to have good TAST. I used the formula above to buy cashtag $TAST. TBH, it slid 85%. 🛝🐩💩 Then, it went up 400% and got bought out. Dr. Stale's formula also led to $YPF, which also slid, then a gain +100%. I did not hold for the slide. So, LESSON LERRNED => possess <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8OnFf1HgBisM"> mathmatical emotions, a calcu-soul. </a></li> 
     <li> My Final Thoughts: (Volume + Equity + PP + P/B or P/S + ROA or ROE) = Energy companies & Banks! Equity & Price Performance don't matter as much... market will eat your prescription lunch (Keynes 🌷) Conviction! Peter Lynch! (Mutally exclusive) Take care of yourself... aaand your stonks.</li>
