    <img class="stonk" src="img/blog_img/forumala_ad.png" alt="stonk ad for Eq. + Vol., Equity & Volume">
    <ul>
    <li> Crypto bears say that the asset of crypto resonates to "pyramids and ponzis". True, Bitcoin's value is essentially based on scarcity. The less of BTC, the more it's worth. Well, what makes a stock price go up in value? The market buys more of the stock, making less shares available. A share is part of a company and a token good for a company's service. You want to Solana an UberEats? That's a fast burger! </li> 
     <li> The formula of Volume + Equity + PP (price performance), if you were on a computer terminal, is like adding the flag -f ü§ì loll üí¨ -ff forced fundamentals. A stock with good fundamentals is not on brand with Keynes! Like vegetables, fundamental stocks are good for the financial body and, also like your veggies, grow slowly. Keynesian stocks means buzz, hype, and the tulip bulb craze üå∑. A highly equitable stock that's been performing exceedingly well, has volume, so everybody likes it can... -fizzle out ü•§ü¶ç</li>
     <li> Peter Lynch, of Fidelity Investments, is famous for patience. He'd say to have good TAST. $TAST is an example of this formula in need of revision. It had the formula metric, fizzled out, üìâ, then the company made headlines and got bought - I didn't have the math emotion to stick a 85% slide that then went up 400%. </li> 
     <li> Well, to be literal and brief, here is your brief: (Vol. + Eq. + PP + P/B or P/S + ROA or ROE, maybe Both) = Energy companies & Banks! Equity & Price Performance doesn't matter as much, as mentioned (Keynes üå∑), and P/S really narrows down your screener. Energy and banks don't move fast, so you can tighten up Vol. and loosen Eq. I bought OBE, chart and sector say I shouldn't. Conviction! Pete! (Mutally exclusive)</li>
