      <p class="casey">When I first saw Mr. Casey Crawford perform stand-up, it was near Fenway Park. Fitting because kept hitting hilarious homeruns.</p>
      <p>So, on Friday, September 20th, Casey continued to raunch-gold jokes for a solid hour. Opener and host, Rob Crean performed tremendously, even a bit more expressive during his set than usual... probably thee excitement of the night 😎</p>
      <img height="33%" width="33%" src="img\casey.jpg">

      <p class="casey2">Casey called his album, "Joke Writer" and it's all killer, no filler. One-liners for an hour... a comic said that's 3 jokes a minute... <span class="nineteen8">180 jokes</span>. Bandcamp for 9-10 bucks? 18 jokes from Boston Comedy winner and Jimmey Kimmel guest - @ 18 jokes a dollar. Dang. That's like nickel brews or somethin'. At the venue where we all had such a good time.... $10 PBRs. Casey should have joked about that by trademark diarrhea'ing on mgmt's faces. 🏁 Great night of comedy. No, that's all. <p padding-top=".9%">*But* I did hear a guy in a Jurassic Park shirt say there was an after-party at a comic's house nearby. So, that's fun. Then, a known kilt-wearer who had a sea-green beard told me he was goin' to party there while I waited an extra 30min at the bus stop 5min away. Man, Casey's great.</p>

      <h3 class="header_color" id="globe">The Globe Reports Indie Beer Fizzlin'</h3>
      The intel will point to a *consolidation of breweries. Jack's Abby (Framingham... not Pressingham) picked up wounded soldier Wormtown Brew of The WOO!cester Area. Dorchester Brewing morphed with Aeronaut, bringing Aeronaut's Everett location to Mass. Ave. in Southie.</p> 
      <span class="globe_beer"></span>
      <p class="fizz_em"><em>To a large extent, the plateau reflects generational drinking habits. Craft beer rose to prominence as millennials reached legal drinking age. But they’re getting older, raising kids and cutting back on the late nights on the town. Gen Z seems to be much less interested in the latest super-hoppy IPA or double barrel aged stout. Brewers also say it’s no coincidence that their industry has stalled out as cannabis products have become more widely available.</em></p>
      <span class="globe_beer"></span>
      <p class="fizzle"><em>"(Dan) Kenary (of S. Boston's Harpoon Brewert) said he noticed that regional craft brewers, relatively larger players that mostly sell through distributors, peaked roughly a decade ago. Microbrewers and taprooms continued to grow, but even those corners of the industry have lost their buzz. Kenary cofounded Harpoon, one of Massachusetts’ first craft brewers, and said he hoped to help stoke a vibrant beer culture in the United States. He and his peers succeeded 'beyond our wildest freaking dreams,'' Kenary said, and then rode the rising tide</em></p>

    <img class="stonk" src="img/frogz.png" alt="stonk ad for Eq. + Vol., Equity & Volume">
    <ul>
     <li> Bitcoin has value based on scarcity. The less of BTC, the more it's worth, i.e. The Halvening. Well, what makes a stock price go up in value? More demand than supply. So, low supply -> BTC Kenosha kastle. A share is part of a company and a token good for a company's service. Can you give Solana to an UberEats? That's a fast burger! And, no, you cannot. </li> 
     <li> I used to use the formula Volume + Equity + Price peformance. Equity not quite profitablity or revenue. So I look up Revenue + P/S Price to Sales and P/B Price to Book, value indicators. You can lookup profit, would, today, add with Volume.</li>
     <li> I used the formula above to buy cashtag $TAST. TBH, it slid 85%. 🛝🐩💩 Then, it went up 400%! and got bought out. Dr. Stale's Version One (PP+EQ+Vol) formula also worked for $CLS, which went from 8 to 260 and $YPF, which slid, then a gain +100%. I did not hold for the slide. So, LESSON LERRNED => possess <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8OnFf1HgBisM"> mathmatical emotions, a calcu-soul. </a></li> 
     <li> Well, now I've added some heavier weights like profit, volume, and oc value. Hey, it's always a great time to invest</li>
